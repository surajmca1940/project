# Digital Psychological Intervention System

## Overview

The Digital Psychological Intervention System is a comprehensive web-based and mobile application designed to address the growing mental health challenges among college students.

## Problem Statement

### Context
Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including:
- Anxiety and depression

There is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges.

### Current Challenges
- Absence of structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention systems
- Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools
